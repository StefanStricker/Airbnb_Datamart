Installation:
For the creation of this Database, I used MySQL Workbench Community Edition and I 
recommend using it for opening this database schema.

First, install MySQL Workbench Community Edition which is free to use. 
You can find it on the website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/ 

After you are finished with the installation, download the datamart.sql FIL in the 
Development folder of this repository. 

Open MySQL Workbench and click: File → Open SQL scripts → choose the datamart.sql 
file
